**GitHub** is a website for **developers** and **programmers** to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of **GitHub** is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity<sup>[1](#f1)</sup> of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software.

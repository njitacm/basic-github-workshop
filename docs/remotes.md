<!-- REMOTES ARE NO JOKING MATTER lol(MEME-less) -->



A remote URL is Git's fancy way of saying **"the place where your code is stored"**

That URL could be your repository on Gitub, or another user's fork, or even on a completely different server. 


## Commands
To create remote repositories
* `git remote add <RemoteName> <RemoteURL>`

To change remote's URL
* `git remote set-url <RemoteName> <RemoteURL> `

* [Git remote Commands](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-remote)

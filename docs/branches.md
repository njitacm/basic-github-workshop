![](../img/branchLolz.jpeg)


**Branches** are ways to isolate development work without affecting other branches in the repository. 

Every repository (repo) has at least 1 default branch. 

_Conventionally_, branches allow:
* Development of Features
* Bug Fixes
* Environment for Experimenting of new ideas, safely

## Commands

To create a new branch
* `git branch <BranchName>`

To switch into a different branch
* `git checkout <BranchName>`

To create and switch to branch
* `git checkout -b <BranchName>`
